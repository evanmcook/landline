hardware for making old telephone handsets into XLR inputs  

[user manual](https://github.com/evanmcook/landline/blob/main/user%20manual/manual.md)

### the earpiece  
turns out that the earpiece of most older telephone handsets is a simple dynamic element.
wire it to a 6.35mm plug, or pins 2 and 3 of an XLR-3 connector, and you've got yourself a microphone

### the mouthpiece

this one's a bit harder. depending on what era your handset is from and which manufacturer it originated from.  
in the most ideal circumstances, you find a handset with a T1 or carbon button transmitter in the mouthpiece. the carbon element is generally very durable, and gives the input signal a lot of character. it's also generally very tolerant of 48v phantom power, which is a boon for us.  
you might also find a carbon-substitute, which is a circuit meant to slot easily into a G-style handset without changing the wiring of the handset.  
these carbon-equivalent electret mics sound great, but if you're after the grit and the grime of a carbon button, a substitute might not give you exactly what you wish.
